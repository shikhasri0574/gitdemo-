    <article>My Coding Journey: From Reluctance to Passion  
      \ My journey into the world of coding has been far from conventional. It began when I entered college and was introduced to a subject called 'PSUC' in my first year, which focused on programming in "C language". At the time, I struggled to connect with C and couldn’t develop an interest in it, despite my efforts. Frustrated, I decided to step back and reassess my approach to programming.  
      In my second year, I was introduced to 'Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)' in "Java", and that marked a turning point. Java sparked a sense of curiosity and excitement in me, and for the first time, coding felt engaging. I immersed myself in learning the language, exploring its features, and building projects.  
        One of the key milestones in this journey was discovering 'Applets in Java', which required the use of "HTML". This exposure to web development ignited a new passion within me. The creative freedom and possibilities that HTML offered captivated me, and I realized that coding was not just about logic but also about creativity and design.  
        From that point on, my coding journey gained momentum. What started as a reluctant introduction turned into an ever-growing passion for technology and programming. Each new language and concept I encountered—whether in Java, HTML, or beyond—added to my enthusiasm and deepened my commitment to learning and growing as a coder.  
        Today, I look back at my journey with gratitude for every challenge and discovery that shaped my perspective. Coding is no longer just an academic requirement; it has become a part of my identity and a pathway to continuous growth and innovation.</article>
